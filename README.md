## Notes

During the project, I encountered some challenges with deployment to GitHub Pages.
Specifically, I had to configure the basename in React Router to ensure routing worked correctly on the GitHub Pages subpath.
Also, setting up the GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment required troubleshooting authentication and build path issues.
Despite these difficulties, I was able to successfully deploy the app and ensure all features work as expected.
